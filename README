   these are some completion functions for the commandline
   JACK patching utilities jack_connect and jack_disconnect.

   they complete port names for you so you don't have to
   copypasta them from jack_lsp.

   uses the old-style zsh completion functions...haven't even
   started porting it to the new-style. i also do not have any
   idea how you install these. let me know if you find out.
